# Sunny Side Cafe
Welcome to Sunny Side Cafe! üç≥üåû

In this game, you are a chef that serves breakfast food at a little cafe. You must flip pancakes, toast some bread, and cook eggs in order to please your customers! Don't forget to choose the right toppings (otherwise your customers might tip you low...)

With no timers, you are under no pressure- so cook at your own pace! If you love playing games like 'Good Pizza, Great Pizza' or 'Papa's Pancakeria' but don't like the stress, then this game is perfect for you!

## Author's Note
This game was made with LOTS of love- from the drawings to the actual code. I hope you enjoy playing this cozy game and enjoy all of the delicious food on your screen!
